# This can be an empty file or include any package-level initialization code.
# For example, if you want to make some functions or variables available
# at the package level, you can define them here.

# You can import modules and functions that you want to make accessible
# directly from the package namespace.

#from .name_generator import generate_name
#from .email_generator import generate_email
# Import other generators as needed

# You might also set some default configurations or values here.
